# VersioningWithATeam


Colin Thomas - I spent most of this summer working. I go around installing networking stuff like security cameras and wireless access points. When I wasn't working I did some fun projects with microcontrollers. I specifically wanted to look in to operating systems made for microcontrollers. I learned a lot about the theory behind operating systems. This lead me to looking in to linux kernel development. The idea that anyone can submit patches to the linux kernel is pretty cool and I'd like to do it eventually. <br /><br />

Jakob Lamb - Most of my time was spent at work this summer. I was able to change departments at my store at the beginning of summer, which came with a small raise. While I wasn't at work, I was playing a lot of Animal Crossing with my friend trying to get our 5 star islands. We also played a lot of Borderlands 2 together. I also been trying to learn more web development. I've been trying more html, css, and javascript because I want to make a portfolio website sometime down the line. During the summer it was also my 21 birthday so I think I'm officially an adult now. Overall, a fun summer despite what we have been going through this year.<br /><br /> 

Duan Rollins - I spent most of the summer working as well. I worked for my local Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago, IL. I was working a lot to get a car for the upcoming school year and I succeeded in doing so. If I wasn't working, I would either be playing my Ps4 or spending time with my girlfriend; I would also be learning more about Web Developement so I can pursue a career into it. I really like web programming because you can do so much in terms of creativity. <br /><br />
