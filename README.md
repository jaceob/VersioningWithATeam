Colin Thomas - 
  I spent most of this summer working. I go around installing networking stuff like security cameras and wireless access points. When I wasn't working I did some fun projects with microcontrollers. I specifically wanted to look in to operating systems made for microcontrollers. I learned a lot about the theory behind operating systems. This lead me to looking in to linux kernel development. The idea that anyone can submit patches to the linux kernel is pretty cool and I'd like to do it eventually. <br />

 I spent most of the summer working as well. I worked for my local Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago, IL. I was working a lot to get a car for the upcoming school year and I succeeded in doing so. If I wasn't working, I would either be playing my Ps4 or spending time with my girlfriend; I would also be learning more about Web Developement so I can pursue a career into it. I really like web programming because you can do so much in terms of creativity.
